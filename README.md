## Why I want to join WhiteHats
I want to join WhiteHats to learn real-world cybersecurity skills, understand how attacks happen, and improve my defensive knowledge. Being part of WhiteHats will help me grow technically, ethically, and professionally in the field of cybersecurity.

## Recent Cybersecurity News / Incident
I recently read about phishing attacks increasing through fake emails and messages that pretend to be from banks or trusted companies. These attacks trick users into sharing passwords and OTPs, showing how important user awareness and secure systems are.
